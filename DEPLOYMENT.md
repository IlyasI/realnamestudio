# Deployment Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure your deployment pipeline to wait for tests before going live.

## 🔒 How It Works

1. **Push code** to GitHub
2. **Tests run automatically** via GitHub Actions
3. **Vercel waits** for tests to pass
4. **Deployment happens** only if tests succeed ✅

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Branch Protection

This ensures tests **must** pass before merging to main.

1. Go to your repo: `https://github.com/IlyasI/realnamestudio/settings/branches`
2. Click **Add branch protection rule**
3. Configure:
   - **Branch name pattern**: `main`
   - ✅ Check **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - ✅ Check **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
   - Under **Status checks that are required**, search and select:
     - `test` (this is your Playwright workflow)
   - ✅ Check **Include administrators**
4. Click **Create** or **Save changes**

### Step 2: Configure Vercel Deployment Checks

1. Go to your project settings: `https://vercel.com/ilyas-projects-a386ad49/realnamestudio/settings`
2. Find the **Deployment Checks** section in the left sidebar
3. Click **Add Checks**
4. Select the GitHub Action that must pass:
   - ✅ Select **test** (your Playwright workflow job name)
5. Save changes

Now your production deployments will wait for the `test` job to pass before promoting to production.

## 🎯 What This Protects Against

- ❌ Deploying broken code
- ❌ Merging failing tests
- ❌ Production bugs from untested changes

## ✅ What You Get

- ✅ All tests pass before deployment
- ✅ Main branch is always stable
- ✅ Automatic test reports
- ✅ Safe to deploy at any time

**Your deployment pipeline is now bulletproof!** 🛡️
