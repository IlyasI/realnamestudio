# Deployment Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure your deployment pipeline to wait for tests before going live.

## 🔒 How It Works

1. **Push code** to GitHub
2. **Tests run automatically** via GitHub Actions
3. **Only if tests pass** → GitHub Actions deploys to Vercel
4. **Deployment happens** only if tests succeed ✅

Everything is controlled by GitHub - no automatic Vercel deployments!

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Branch Protection ✅ DONE

This ensures tests **must** pass before merging to main.

Already configured to require the `test` status check to pass.

### Step 2: Set Up Vercel GitHub Secrets

GitHub Actions needs credentials to deploy to Vercel. Set these up once:

1. **Create a Vercel Token:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
   - Click **Create Token**
   - Name it: `github-actions-deploy`
   - Copy the token (you'll only see it once!)

2. **Add GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/IlyasI/realnamestudio/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click **New repository secret** and add these three:

   ```
   Name: VERCEL_TOKEN
   Value: <paste the token you just created>
   ```

   ```
   Name: VERCEL_ORG_ID
   Value: team_Ts6OLGJOL3ztRuFFmQd7edmt
   ```

   ```
   Name: VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
   Value: prj_VfftJqbcTNjLK3PlhPKMAXiYKjCK
   ```

3. **Done!** Once these secrets are added, the workflow will automatically deploy after tests pass.

## 🎯 What This Protects Against

- ❌ Deploying broken code
- ❌ Merging failing tests
- ❌ Production bugs from untested changes

## ✅ What You Get

- ✅ All tests pass before deployment
- ✅ Main branch is always stable
- ✅ Automatic test reports
- ✅ Safe to deploy at any time
